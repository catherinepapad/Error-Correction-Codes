# Error Correction Codes
Assignments for "Error Correction Codes" course of ECE in AUTh. 

In digital communications, the integrity and reliability of transmitted data is crucial. Error Correction
Codes (ECC) are used to detect and correct errors that may occur due to factors such as noise,
interference or other disruptions in the communication system. This assignment examines several
different methods that are used for error correction.

## Part 1
This segment focuses on the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC), where 2 different cases are studied.

### Part 1a 
Here, the focus lies on Linear Block Bodes. Both encoding and modulation are considered. The
goal is to draw conclusions about how the modulation order, codeword length and Symbol to Noise
Ratio (SNR) influence the Bit Error Rate (BER) and the transmission rate.

### Part 1b 
In this section, only encoding is taken into account, omitting modulation considerations. The scenario
revolves around the use of more than one channel with different error probabilities. The goal is to
draw conclusions about the optimal use of all available channels to achieve fast and reliable data
transmission.

## Part 2 
This section delves into the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC), where Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes are
used. The goal is to compare regular and irregular LDPC codes, study their performance and
evaluate the potential improvements offered by the irregular codes.
